App Idea:
    As a student, I get overwhelmed with assignments. It would be nice to have a easy to use app that shows all my assignments and things I need to do. Similar to a planner/agenda that is simple enough that it does not get cluttered and easy to use. You can create a checklist that lists all your assignments or tasks  that needs to be completed. You can move the items to put them in a order or importance.
